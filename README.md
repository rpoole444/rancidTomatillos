## Abstract 

This project is designed to allow users to learn more about the latest popular movies. As the user visits the page, a number of movie posters are displayed. The main page also includes a search bar that allows users to find any of the films by title. A user can click on each movie poster and a new page will open with all of the film details. Once a user is on the details page, they will see an official trailer for that film, embedded from youtube. The page will also display overview, runtime, release date, budget, and revenue. When the user chooses to return home, they can click a home button on the top left of the screen. If there is an lag from the server, the app also includes loading pages in between page load, as well as error handling if the page is not found. 

## Learning Goals

- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Wins & Challenges

- Successfully created our first app using React
- Successfully implemented Router
- Successfully learned how to use iframe and bring in movie trailers from youtube using the film's Id
- Successfully implemented cypress testing to check functionality
- Successfully implemented loading and error handling 

- Using router was a learning curve, but ultimately made connecting a multi-page app much easier 
- Learning cypress was something new for us, so getting th syntax correct took additional research. 
- Error and loading functionality was very tricky but we were able to add properties to state to handle loading. 
- We would have liked to use implement more page responsiveness with a media queries.
